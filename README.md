## Gameplay Overview
In this game, you start with nothing but your fists to smash through blocks and explore deeper into the mysterious cave. Soon you return to the furnace to upgrade and receive your new weapon, a doll look-a-like.

This explosive doll allows you to mine even further into the depths. *But the challenge doesn't stop there!*

Your new mission is to rescue a lost kitten 🐱 and bring it back to the furnace before time runs out and everything explodes💥!

**Can you save the kitten and escape in time?**
